Ecommerce Web-App is divided into three major modules

1)User
2)Item
3)Order

1)User:-

		a)SignUp Api:- User signs up by providing certain information as provided into User Entity
		b)Login Api:-User logs in by giving credentials
		
2)Item:-
		a)This module consists of CRUD operations where in user can Create,Retrieve,Update And Delete Items by providing credentails.
		
3)Order:-
		a)Create Api:- User can place order by providing  the item id as URL parameter and quantity as well as email id of the user as Request Body of Post Api.
		Since order needs to have item as its property, i have used the concept of @Embeddable in ItemDTo and @Embedded in Order Entity
		b)Get All Orders:- User can get all the orders he/she has placed.
		
		
Please Note:- I have also provided Swagger documentation which consists of the API's documentation.
